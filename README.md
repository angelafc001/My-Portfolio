This is my final prototype for my CSS497 class. 
This is a personal portfolio writen in HTML 5, CSS3, Javascript, and Bootstrap 4. It contains information of my skills, education, experience, and programming projects.

I followed Daily Tuition's YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgKSqz3it50&t=11095s),
and also added my personal style to my portfolio.

To run it, simply clone the repo, and open the 'index.html' file in your internet browser.
